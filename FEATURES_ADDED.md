## Enhanced Application Context Features

### Context-Aware Guidance
- **Loading Conditions**: Smart suggestions based on application type
  - House utility: Static (pipes, ducts), Cyclic (water heater, appliances)
  - Office materials: Static (desks, panels), Cyclic (chairs, drawers)

- **Environment Recommendations**: Application-specific environment guidance
  - House utility: Indoor (most systems), Chemical (water treatment)
  - Office materials: Indoor/controlled climate, minimal environmental stress

- **Design Life Suggestions**: Realistic lifespan recommendations
  - House utility: 20-50 years
  - Office materials: 10-20 years

- **Safety Factor Guidelines**: Application-appropriate safety factors
  - House utility: 2.0-3.0x
  - Office materials: 1.5-2.5x

### Quick Application Selection
Added new badge options for rapid application selection:
- House utility plumbing
- Electrical conduit systems
- HVAC ductwork
- Office desk surfaces
- Office chair frames
- Acoustic panels

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Template Categories**: Applications now organized by category including "House Utility" and "Office Materials"

2. **Smart Context Detection**: System automatically recognizes house utility and office applications in descriptions

3. **Relevant Property Focus**: Emphasizes appropriate properties for each application type (electrical properties for conduits, thermal properties for HVAC)

4. **Realistic Requirements**: All templates use practical, industry-standard requirements

## How to Use the New Features

1. **Quick Selection**: Use the badge buttons in the Application Context section to instantly apply common house utility or office material requirements

2. **Template Browser**: Click the "Templates" button to browse all available application templates by category

3. **Context-Aware Help**: Enter an application description containing words like "plumbing," "office," "desk," or "conduit" to receive intelligent parameter suggestions

4. **One-Click Setup**: Select any template to automatically populate all relevant filters and requirements

## Benefits

- **Faster Setup**: Common applications can be configured in seconds rather than minutes
- **Better Accuracy**: Industry-standard requirements reduce guesswork
- **Professional Guidance**: Expert-level parameter suggestions for non-experts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports both residential utility and commercial office applications

These additions make MatOpt AI significantly more useful for facility managers, contractors, office planners, and anyone working with building materials or office infrastructure.
