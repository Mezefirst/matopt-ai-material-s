- **Trigger**: User clicks "Get AI Recommendations" or asks natural language questions
- **Progression**: Input requirements → AI analysis → Ranked recommendations with reasoning → User selects candidates
- **Success criteria**: Recommendations include confidence scores and clear explanations for material choices

### Material Comparison Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Side-by-side comparison of selected materials with visual charts and trade-off analysis
- **Purpose**: Enables informed decision-making by highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs
- **Trigger**: User selects multiple materials from search results
- **Progression**: Select materials → View comparison table → Analyze charts → Review trade-offs → Make decision
- **Success criteria**: Clear visualization of differences with exportable comparison data

### Supplier Integration
- **Functionality**: Display supplier information, pricing, and availability for each material
- **Purpose**: Connects material selection to procurement reality and regional availability
- **Trigger**: User views material details or comparison results
- **Progression**: View material → Check supplier info → Contact suppliers → Get quotes
- **Success criteria**: Up-to-date supplier contact information and regional availability indicators

## Edge Case Handling

- **No Search Results**: Display helpful suggestions for adjusting criteria with common alternatives
- **Network Issues**: Cache recent searches and provide offline comparison functionality
- **Invalid Input Ranges**: Auto-correct impossible specifications with helpful explanations

- **Supplier Unavailability**: Show backup suppliers and similar materials from available vendors

## Design Direction

The interface should feel precise and analytical like professional engineering tools, while maintaining the approachability of modern design software, balancing technical accuracy with visual clarity.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme emphasizing trust, precision, and innovation with measured restraint to maintain professional credibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 260)) - Communicates reliability and technical expertise
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm Gray (oklch(0.65 0.02 80)) for neutral backgrounds and Steel Blue (oklch(0.55 0.12 240)) for secondary actions
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange (oklch(0.70 0.20 45)) - Highlights key insights and call-to-action elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Light Gray oklch(0.98 0.005 80)): Dark Text (oklch(0.15 0.01 260)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Card (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Text (oklch(0.15 0.01 260)) - Ratio 15.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 260)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Warm Gray oklch(0.65 0.02 80)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0.01 260)) - Ratio 4.7:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Orange oklch(0.70 0.20 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and clarity, using Inter for its exceptional legibility at all sizes and technical aesthetic appropriate for data-heavy interfaces.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Metadata): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing
  - Data Labels: Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that reinforce the app's analytical nature while providing clear feedback for user interactions and data updates.
