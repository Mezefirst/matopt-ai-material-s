# MatOpt AI Overview Section Debug Guide

## Problem Identified
The Overview section was not showing results because users didn't understand the material selection workflow.

## Root Cause
The app has a 4-step workflow:
1. Set filters/requirements  
2. Search for materials
3. **Select materials using checkboxes** ← Users were missing this step
4. View comparison in Overview tab

## Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Step 2 UI**: Made it clear that users need to select materials using checkboxes
2. **Added Progress Indicators**: Show "Step 1 Complete" and "Step 2: Select Materials" 
3. **Improved Instructions**: Added step-by-step guide with numbered steps
4. **Visual Cues**: Better checkbox examples and call-to-action
5. **Quick Tip Banner**: Added helpful guidance above material cards

## How to Test
1. Go to the app
2. Set some basic requirements (e.g., tensile strength > 100)
3. Click "Search Materials" 
4. You should see "Step 2: Select Materials" instructions
5. Click checkboxes next to 2+ materials
6. The overview should now show the comparison table

## Expected Behavior  
- When no materials selected: Shows selection interface with clear instructions
- When 2+ materials selected: Shows MaterialComparison component with detailed table
- When no search performed: Shows "get started" guide with step-by-step instructions

## Technical Details
The logic is in App.tsx lines 572-680:
```
if (selectedMaterials.length > 0) → Show comparison
else if (filteredMaterials.length > 0) → Show selection interface  
else → Show get started guide
```
